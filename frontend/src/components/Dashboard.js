        <h2>Advancements in Telemedicine</h2>
        <p>
          Telemedicine has emerged as a pivotal innovation in healthcare, transforming how patients access medical services. This technology allows patients to consult healthcare providers remotely, using video conferencing, phone calls, or messaging systems. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of telemedicine, as it provided a safe alternative to in-person visits, minimizing the risk of virus transmission. Telehealth has proven particularly beneficial for individuals in rural or underserved regions, where access to medical facilities is limited. It offers convenience, reduces travel time, and enables continuous monitoring of chronic conditions. Advances in telemedicine are now integrating artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance diagnostic accuracy and predictive analytics. Wearable devices are also playing a significant role by tracking vital signs and health metrics in real-time, allowing for proactive healthcare interventions. As telemedicine continues to evolve, it holds the promise of making healthcare more accessible, efficient, and personalized.

        <h2>Technical Description</h2>
        <p>
          This application, H78, is built using the MERN stackâ€”MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The backend is powered by Node.js with Express.js handling HTTP requests and routing. MongoDB serves as the database, storing user credentials and chart data securely. JWT authentication ensures secure user sessions. The frontend is developed with React, providing a responsive and dynamic user interface. D3.js is utilized for creating interactive and dynamic charts on the Summary and Reports pages. The application adheres to accessibility standards, incorporating ARIA roles and keyboard navigation. The entire application is hosted on a single server with NGINX serving the frontend on port 80 and proxying API calls to the backend on port 3000.
